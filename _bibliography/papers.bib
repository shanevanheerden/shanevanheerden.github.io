  title={Optimisation of stock keeping unit placement in a retail distribution centre},
  abstract={The retail problem of slotting refers to the assignment of <em>stock keeping units</em> (SKUs) to the available storage locations in a <em>distribution centre</em> (DC). Generally, the expected total distance travelled by stock pickers during an order consolidation and the resulting level of congestion experienced within aisle racking are common considerations when making these assignments. These criteria give rise to a bi-objective optimisation model with the aim of identifying multiple stock setups that achieve acceptable tradeoffs between minimising the criteria on expectation. A mathematical framework is established in this paper, based on these two criteria, for evaluating the effectiveness of a given stock setup. In the framework, a stock picker's movement between various storage locations is modelled as a Markov chain in order to quantify his or her expected travel distance, while a closed queuing network model is used to devise a suitable measure of congestion. This optimisation model framework forms the basis of a flexible <em>decision support system</em> (DSS) for the purpose of discovering high-quality stock assignment trade-off solutions for inventory managers. The DSS is applied to a special case study involving data from a real DC, and the desirability of the recommended stock configurations is compared with that currently implemented within the DC.},

  title={Towards a descriptive model of road accident risk (preprint)},
  abstract={With the enormous losses to society resulting from <em>road accidents</em> (RAs), their prevention and severity reduction has been an active area of research focus for many decades. Over the years, researchers have proposed a wide variety of principles and models related to road safety, many of which attempt to draw insights from historical RA and exposure data. In this paper, a novel descriptive model is proposed for quantifying the risk posed by various
 roadway characteristics along a road network which takes inspiration from the three dimensions of road safety and employs network <em>Kernel Density Estimation</em> (KDE). Risk, in this context, is modelled as both the rate and severity of being involved in an RA. The proposed methodology is applied to a real-world case study based on public accident and road data so as to demonstrate its intended functionality in the context of a realistic setting.},
