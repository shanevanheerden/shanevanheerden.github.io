Hi there and welcome to my personal website! My name is Shane and I believe in the potential for Artificial Intelligence to fundamentally change the world for the better. I'm a Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer by trade with demonstrated experience in leading Data Science projects and developing AI solutions for real-world problems. I have strong knowledge in deep learning, data engineering and object-oriented programming, and a passion for discovering insights from structured and unstructured data.
<br><br>
My educational background includes a degree in Industrial Engineering from Stellenbosch University, as well as a PhD in Machine Learning, which I earned after successfully defending my research on using machine learning to predict road accident risk. Currently, I am working at Luno, a cryptocurrency exchange, where I use my expertise in Data Science and Machine Learning to lead the development of predictive models that help combat fraudulent activity on the platform.

Feel free to browse my thoughts and experiences on all topics related to Data Science and Machine Learning. Thank you for stopping by and I hope you enjoy your visit.
