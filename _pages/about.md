As a curious Industrial Engineer turned Data Scientist, I thrive on work that challenges me to think both logically and creatively when solving complex problems. I have a strong interest in Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, cryptocurrency, Operations Research and object-orientated programming, and excel when tasked with discovering insights in structured and unstructured data.

Inspired by practitioners like Jeff Dean and David Silver, my true passion lies in leveraging techniques and algorithms on the forefront of Machine Learning to develop productisable AI that can be a positive force for change in the world.
