Hi there and welcome to my personal website! My name is Shane and I believe in the potential for Artificial Intelligence to fundamentally change the world for the better. I am currently a Senior Data Scientist at <a href='http://www.luno.com'>Luno</a>, a cryptocurrency exchange, where I use my expertise to lead the development of predictive models that help combat fraudulent activity on the platform.
<br><br>
I'm a Machine Learning Engineer by trade with demonstrated experience in leading Data Science projects and developing AI solutions for real-world problems. My educational background includes a bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering, as well as a PhD in Machine Learning from Stellenbosch University. I have strong knowledge in Deep Learning, MLOps and Natural Language Processing, and a passion for discovering insights from structured and unstructured data.

Feel free to browse my thoughts and experiences on all topics related to Data Science and Machine Learning. Thank you for stopping by and I hope you enjoy your visit!
