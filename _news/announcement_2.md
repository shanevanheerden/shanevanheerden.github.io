I am excited to announce that I have graduated from Stellenbosch University with a BEng degree in Industrial Engineering. This is a major milestone in my academic and professional journey, and I am grateful for the opportunity to have studied at such a prestigious institution.

As an Industrial Engineer, I have learned how to analyze and design complex systems, as well as how to problem-solve and communicate effectively. These skills will serve me well as I embark on my career and work to improve systems, processes, and organizations.

Looking back on my time at Stellenbosch University, I am grateful for the experiences and growth that I have had. As I embark on my career, I will continue to be open to new opportunities and challenges and strive to learn and grow even more.
