I am thrilled to announce that I have recently joined the Stellenbosch Unit for Operations Research in Engineering (SUnORE) to pursue my master's degree. SUnORE is a leading research group situated within the Department of Industrial Engineering at Stellenbosch University, and it has an impressive reputation for conducting both fundamental and applied research in the fields of operations research, data science, and machine learning.

I am excited to be part of such a dynamic and innovative group that is committed to achieving excellence in all its activities. SUnORE's vision of *"Analysis in support of effective decisions"* and its mission of being *"an inclusive environment for the training, development, and inspiration of innovative, yet responsible, scientific young minds"* align perfectly with my personal goals and aspirations.

My research will focus on understanding and reducing the risk of road accidents, which are a major cause of death worldwide. I'm developing a framework that uses machine learning to analyze data on past accidents, including information on the road, vehicles, and casulaties involved, to identify the factors that contribute to higher accident risk. By processing this data in a structured way, we can create more accurate predictions about where accidents are likely to occur and how severe they are likely to be. This will help governments design safer roads and implement measures to prevent accidents. I will be applying this framework to real-world case studies using road accident data from Greater Manchester in the United Kingdom.

Overall, I am thrilled to have the opportunity to work with such a talented and dedicated team at SUnORE and to be a part of a broader scientific community that is committed to pushing the boundaries of knowledge and innovation. I am confident that this experience will be a pivotal moment in my academic journey and will provide me with the skills and knowledge I need to make a positive impact in the world.
