From June 23rd to 26th, 2019, I had the incredible opportunity to attend the <a href='https://euro2019.euro-online.org/'>30th <em>European Conference on Operational Research</em></a> (EURO) at University College Dublin, Dublin Ireland. As a PhD researcher, I was excited to present my research findings and explore the latest ideas and advancements in the fields of Operations Research and Machine Learning.
<br>
One of the highlights of the conference was hearing <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Cook'>William Cook</a>'s plenary talk about the history of the Traveling Salesman Problem and his co-authored Concorde solving method. The Traveling Salesman Problem is a classic optimization problem in which a salesman must visit a given set of cities, each only once, and return to his starting point, while minimizing the total distance traveled. Cook's Concorde method is a cutting-edge optimization algorithm that can find the exact solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem for small to medium-sized instances, and it was fascinating to hear about the history of this problem and its solution.
<br>
In addition to attending the plenary talks and presentations, I was also able to attend several workshops and tutorials that were focused on various topics related to Operations Research and Machine Learning. I learned about new research and advancements in the field, and was able to discuss my own research with other researchers and experts, which was incredibly valuable.
<br>
In addition to the academic aspect, the conference also provided ample opportunities for networking with other researchers in the field. I met researchers from all over the world who were working on similar research topics and connected with them on a personal and professional level. The discussions were insightful, and it was great to connect with fellow researchers who are equally passionate about advancing the field of Machine Learning.
<br>
Overall, the 30th EURO Conference was a fantastic experience, and I am grateful for the opportunity to have attended and presented my research findings. I look forward to attending more conferences in the future and continuing to learn about new research and advancements in my field.
