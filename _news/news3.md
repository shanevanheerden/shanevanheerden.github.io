I recently had the opportunity to present my final year project at the 45th Operations Research Society of South Africa (ORSSA) Annual Conference held at the beautiful Lanzerac Wine Estate in Stellenbosch (see programme [here](https://www.orssa.org.za/_files/ugd/568002_12362917897941f08647b3cebdf0b61e.pdf)). As a student passionate about the application of Operations Research in real-life problems, it was a privilege to participate in a conference that showcased cutting-edge research on topics such as risk and cost modelling, malaria disease modelling, heuristics for portfolio decision analysis, and multicriteria decision analysis.

In my presentation, titled *"The placement of stock keeping units in a retail distribution centre"*, I discussed the challenges faced by large retailers in managing and coordinating multiple activities in their supply chain, particularly in the efficient storage and consolidation of finished goods in a distribution center. I focused on the retail problem of slotting, which involves the assignment of stock keeping units (SKUs) to the available storage spaces in a distribution center. This problem can be quite complex, ruling out the possibility of an investigation of the entire solution space. Therefore, my research pursued the most common objectives of minimising the expected stock picker travel distance and minimising aisle congestion.

To solve this problem, I employed a multi-objective simulated annealing approach to determine trade-off solutions to the bi-objective slotting model, and I embedded this solution approach in a user-friendly decision support system. The system receives the required inputs and presents the proposed stock set-up as output. To demonstrate the practical applicability and flexibility of the decision support system, I applied it to a small hypothetical problem instance. The feasibility of a stock configuration recommended by the system was assessed by comparing the results to the actual stock set-up used by the retail distribution centre.

During the conference, I had the opportunity to attend various talks and presentations on topics of risk and cost modelling, heuristics for portfolio decision analysis, and multicriteria decision analysis, among others. The conference was not all work and no play, though. There was an Operations Research Wine Hunt that challenged participants to solve mathematical and statistical problems to win prizes, as well as the annual conference banquet where the Society's awards were presented. I am grateful for the opportunity to have been a part of such a stimulating event and look forward to attending more ORSSA conferences in the future.
