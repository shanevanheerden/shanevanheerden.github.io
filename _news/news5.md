I'm excited to share that <a href='https://sunore.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SA_vanHeerden.pdf'>my final-year project</a> won the Best Decision Support System award at my graduation function! My project looked at how to better organize stock in retail distribution centers ‚Äî specifically, the tricky task of deciding where different products should be stored (what we call "slotting" in the industry).
</p>
<p align="justify">
The tricky part was balancing two competing goals: making sure stock pickers don't have to walk too far, while also preventing bottlenecks in the aisles.  I developed a mathematical model using something called bi-objective optimization, which helped find solutions that strike a good balance between these goals and suggest optimized storage layouts.

I turned this into a practical tool that warehouse managers can use to figure out better product arrangements. To test it out, I worked with real data from an actual retail distribution center and compared my system's recommendations to their current setup. I'm really honored to receive this recognition, and I'm keen to tackle more of these complex business problems in my career ahead!
