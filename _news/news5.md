I am thrilled to announce that <a href='https://sunore.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SA_vanHeerden.pdf'>my final-year project</a> has been awarded the Best Decision Support System prize at my graduation function. My project, titled <em>"The Placement of Stock Keeping Units in a Retail Distribution Centre"</em>, focused on the challenge of efficiently managing the storage and consolidation of finished goods within a <em>distribution center</em> (DC), with a particular emphasis on the retail problem of <em>slotting</em>.
</p>
<p align="justify">
In order to optimize the slotting process and balance conflicting objectives of minimizing travel distance for stock pickers while also minimizing aisle congestion, I established a mathematical framework and constructed a bi-objective optimization model. Through the use of a multi-objective simulated annealing approach, my model was able to provide high-quality solutions that embody trade-offs between these objectives.
</p>
<p align="justify">
I packaged this model into a flexible decision support system that can recommend high-quality stock setups for real-life DCs. I am proud to have applied this system to a special case study using real-life data and compared its recommendation with the actual stock setup implemented at the retail DC under consideration. I am incredibly grateful for this recognition, and I look forward to continuing to apply my skills and knowledge to tackle complex business challenges in the future.
