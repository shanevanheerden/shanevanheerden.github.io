I am thrilled to announce that [my final-year project](https://sunore.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SA_vanHeerden.pdf) has been awarded the Best Decision Support System prize at my graduation function. My project, titled *"The Placement of Stock Keeping Units in a Retail Distribution Centre"*, focused on the challenge of efficiently managing the storage and consolidation of finished goods within a distribution center (DC), with a particular emphasis on the retail problem of slotting.

In order to optimize the slotting process and balance conflicting objectives of minimizing travel distance for stock pickers while also minimizing aisle congestion, I established a mathematical framework and constructed a bi-objective optimization model. Through the use of a multi-objective simulated annealing approach, my model was able to provide high-quality solutions that embody trade-offs between these objectives.

I packaged this model into a flexible decision support system that can recommend high-quality stock setups for real-life DCs. I am proud to have applied this system to a special case study using real-life data and compared its recommendation with the actual stock setup implemented at the retail DC under consideration. I am incredibly grateful for this recognition, and I look forward to continuing to apply my skills and knowledge to tackle complex business challenges in the future.
