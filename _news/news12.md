I recently had the opportunity to present my Masters at the 47th Annual Conference of the *Operations Research Society of South Africa* (ORSSA), which took place at the CSIR International Conference Centre in Pretoria (see programme [here](https://www.orssa.org.za/_files/ugd/568002_9b994f1dbca247cba2307b26d72cb25b.pdf)). The conference was a highlight on the ORSSA calendar and brought together a diverse range of professionals from the fields of machine learning, OR in energy and healthcare, and behavioural modelling and data analysis.

During my presentation, I introduced a model framework that can be used to quantify the risk experienced by road users in different driving scenarios. I explained how this framework, which incorporates techniques from the realm of machine learning, can be used to analyze various road accident factors that contribute to higher levels of risk.

One of the highlights of the conference was the keynote speeches given by Professor Liezl van Dyk and Charles Malack Oloo. Both speakers gave thought-provoking talks that challenged us to think differently about the role of operations research in industrial engineering and in solving some of Africa's most pressing problems.

Aside from the scientific program, the conference is also renowned for its social events. I had the opportunity to catch up with friends and colleagues, some of whom I only see once a year at this gathering. The Society's AGM was followed by an inflatable truck that was serving soft-serve ice-cream and toppings â€” a truly memorable touch! The gin tasting at the Monday evening social event was another highlight, with three flavours of seemingly bottomless Mirari Gin available to be mixed and matched with various fruits, spices, and tonics. The Banquet was the climax of the social program, where we celebrated the award winners and enjoyed more delicious food.

Overall, the conference was a productive and inspiring few days that provided ample opportunities to exchange valuable ideas and make new friends and colleagues. I look forward to attending the next ORSSA conference and continuing to contribute to the advancement of research in my field.
