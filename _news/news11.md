Attending the <a href='https://deeplearningindaba.com/2018/'>Deep Learning Indaba</a> at Stellenbosch University in South Africa was a truly transformative experience for me. From September 9th to 14th, 2018, I had the opportunity to immerse myself in the world of machine learning and artificial intelligence, and to learn from some of the most renowned experts in the field.

The Indaba, whose mission is to strengthen AI on the African continent, provided a platform for teaching, research, exchange, and debate around the latest developments in the field. Among the prestigious speakers at the event were <a href='https://research.google/people/jeff/'>Jeff Dean</a>, a senior researcher at Google, and <a href='https://www.davidsilver.uk/'>David Silver</a> the lead researcher on the <a href='https://www.deepmind.com/research/highlighted-research/alphago'>AlphaGo project</a> at DeepMind.

One of the highlights of the Indaba for me was the chance to hear Jeff Dean speak about the role of AI in advancing healthcare and scientific research. His talk was both informative and inspiring, and provided a glimpse into the exciting potential of what the future may hold. Another highlight was the opportunity to attend a talk by David Silver, who is widely regarded as one of the leading experts in the field of reinforcement learning. In his talk, he provided an in-depth look at the principles and techniques behind reinforcement learning, and shared some of his insights on how this approach can be applied to a wide range of problems.

In addition to the talks and workshops, the Indaba also provided a chance for participants to engage in networking and exchange with other researchers and practitioners in the field. Between sessions, I found myself in such interesting conversations with researchers and developers from across the globe. Each person brought their own perspective on where AI is headed and how it could make a difference in their corner of the world.
