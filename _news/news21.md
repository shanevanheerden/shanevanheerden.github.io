I'm still buzzing with excitement after the 2023 Luno Summit! Not only did I get to connect with my fellow Lunauts and partake in the fun Summit games, but I also was incredibly honoured to have been recognised with the *Rising Star: Our Lunaut of the Year* award. This is a peer-nominated award presented to the Lunaut who best embodies:

1. **Exceptional Performance:** Consistently raising the bar and demonstrating exceptional results in their role.
2. **Positive Impact:** Making a significant positive impact on Luno, our company goals, or our culture.
3. **Strong Collaboration:** Exhibit strong collaboration skills and inspire others within the team and across departments.
4. **Innovation and Initiative:** Shows a commitment to innovation and takes the initiative to improve processes, solve problems, and drive positive change.
5. **Continuous Learning:** Invests in their professional development, acquires new skills, and applies their knowledge to benefit Luno.
6. **Adaptability and Resilience:** Demonstrates the ability to adapt to change, overcome challenges, and maintains a positive attitude.
7. **Customer Focus:** Consistently prioritises the satisfaction of both internal and external customers, delivering exceptional service.
8. **Dependability and Reliability:** Known for their reliability, consistency, and commitment to meeting deadlines and obligations.
9. **Positive Attitude:** Maintain a positive, can-do attitude and contribute to a motivating and supportive work environment.

Receiving this award is a truly a highlight of my Luno career. To be recognized by my peers in a company of 600+ amazing people, especially for embodying the very essence of Moontality, our company culture, is truly humbling. I'm incredibly grateful for the opportunity to work alongside such talented and passionate individuals, who constantly inspire me to push myself to be the best version of myself.
