From June 23rd to 26th, 2019, I had the incredible opportunity to attend the 30th European Conference on Operational Research (EURO) at University College Dublin, Dublin Ireland. As a PhD researcher, I was excited to present my research findings and explore the latest ideas and advancements in the fields of Operations Research and Machine Learning.

One of the highlights of the conference was hearing William Cook's plenary talk about the history of the Traveling Salesman Problem and his co-authored Concorde solving method. The Traveling Salesman Problem is a classic optimization problem in which a salesman must visit a given set of cities, each only once, and return to his starting point, while minimizing the total distance traveled. Cook's Concorde method is a cutting-edge optimization algorithm that can find the exact solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem for small to medium-sized instances, and it was fascinating to hear about the history of this problem and its solution.

In addition to attending the plenary talks and presentations, I was also able to attend several workshops and tutorials that were focused on various topics related to Operations Research and Machine Learning. I learned about new research and advancements in the field, and was able to discuss my own research with other researchers and experts, which was incredibly valuable.

In addition to the academic aspect, the conference also provided ample opportunities for networking with other researchers in the field. I met researchers from all over the world who were working on similar research topics and connected with them on a personal and professional level. The discussions were insightful, and it was great to connect with fellow researchers who are equally passionate about advancing the field of Machine Learning.

Overall, the 30th European Conference on Operational Research (EURO) was a fantastic experience, and I am grateful for the opportunity to have attended and presented my research findings. I look forward to attending more conferences in the future and continuing to learn about new research and advancements in my field.
