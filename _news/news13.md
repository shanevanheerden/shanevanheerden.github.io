On the 23rd of January 2019, I had the privilege of defending my Masters research in front of a captivated audience at the esteemed Stellenbosch Institute for Advanced Study. This pivotal moment marked the culmination of two years of dedicated work and unwavering passion for exploring the limitless possibilities of Data Science and Machine Learning.

My research focused on a critical global issue: road accidents, which tragically claim a significant number of lives each year and rank as the eighth leading cause of death worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. Understanding the contributing factors to road accidents and finding effective preventive measures has been the subject of extensive research since the advent of motorized vehicles. Driven by a determination to make a meaningful contribution, I delved deep into the world of data mining, leveraging cutting-edge techniques to unravel the complex dynamics of road accident risks.

Within the realm of road accident research, the integration of data mining techniques and advancements in artificial intelligence presented an exciting opportunity for statistical and machine learning breakthroughs. However, the formidable challenge of data pre-processing often consumed considerable time and effort.

Recognizing the need for a comprehensive framework, I proposed a modular data mining approach in my master's thesis. This approach facilitated data attribute formatting, correction of missing or erroneous values, and the merging of disparate data sets. The configuration and enhancement procedures within the framework ensured the production of high-quality, all-encompassing data sets, ready for in-depth analysis. Finally, the transformation procedure harnessed the power of machine learning, transitional road safety, and network spatial analysis approaches to comprehensively assess road accident risks.

The day of my defense was filled with anticipation and excitement. I had precisely ten minutes to present my research to a diverse audience, who engaged eagerly with thought-provoking questions. Following this public session, I transitioned into a closed examination phase, where my internal and external examiners delved deeper into the intricacies of my work. Their insightful inquiries served as a testament to the meticulousness of my research process.

After the intense examination, a sense of relief enveloped the room as my examiners informed me of my success in defending my Masters. It was a moment of profound gratification, a testament to the countless hours of dedication and perseverance invested in my research. Moreover, due to the significant research novelty exhibited in my work, they extended a generous offer to upgrade my master's to a PhD, an opportunity I graciously accepted.

Reflecting on that day, I am humbled by the support and encouragement I received from my mentors, peers, and loved ones. It was their unwavering belief in me that fueled my determination to achieve this milestone. My research journey has been challenging yet deeply fulfilling, and I am now thrilled to embrace the next chapter in my academic pursuit.
