I had the pleasure of presenting my master's research at the 47th Annual ORSSA Conference, held at the Champagne Sports Resort in the beautiful Drakensberg Mountains (see programme <a href='https://www.orssa.org.za/_files/ugd/568002_9b57b7647e874b8fa1f6c6666cdc9847.pdf'>here</a>). The conference was a gathering of scholars and enthusiasts of operations research, all eager to share their knowledge and insights on the latest developments in the field.

The keynote speeches from Dr. Susara van den Heever and Prof. Riaan de Jongh were especially inspiring, as they discussed the future of <em>Operations Research</em> (OR) in the context of new developments in Big Data and Data Sciences. It was a privilege to hear from John Chaves from IBM, who shared his expertise on creating optimization applications through the use of IBMâ€™s Decision Optimization Center.

My presentation focused on the development of accurate prediction models to quantify and characterise the risk experienced by an individual in some geographical locale (usually a roadway segment or intersection), which could help in the implementation of more effective traffic safety control policies on public roads. I reviewed different road risk evaluation methods in conjunction with the possible application of various machine learning algorithms. My aim was to create a decision support system capable of identifying road accident patterns related to a specific geographical locale.

Aside from the academic discussions, the conference also provided plenty of opportunities for networking and socializing. The cocktail evening on the Terrace provided a breathtaking view of the Central Drakensberg, and the Monday night social event was a true South African Braai, accompanied by a live duo performance. The highlight of the social program was the conference banquet, during which the highly anticipated award ceremony took place.

Overall, the conference was an enriching experience that provided a platform for intellectual exchange, networking, and socialising in a beautiful setting. It was an honor to be part of such an esteemed event and to engage with fellow scholars and OR enthusiasts who share my passion for research and innovation.
