I'm excited to share that I've just started my master's degree at the <a href='https://sunore.co.za/'>Stellenbosch Unit for Operations Research in Engineering</a> (SUnORE). Based in Stellenbosch University's Industrial Engineering Department, SUnORE is doing fascinating work at the intersection of operations research, data science, and machine learning.

What drew me to SUnORE was their commitment to both academic excellence and real-world impact. Their motto <em>"Analysis in support of effective decisions"</em>em resonates strongly with me, as does their focus on nurturing young researchers in an inclusive environment.

For my research, I'm tackling the global challenge of road safety. I'm building a machine learning framework that digs into accident data - everything from road conditions to vehicle types to injury patterns - to better understand what makes some situations more dangerous than others. By analyzing this data systematically, we can help predict high-risk areas and potential accident severity. The end goal is to give governments practical insights for designing safer roads and preventing accidents before they happen. I'll be testing this approach using road accident data from the UK.

I feel fortunate to be working alongside such talented researchers at SUnORE. It's still early days, but I can already tell this experience will shape my future in ways I couldn't have imagined.
