I am delighted to announce that I have been elected as the Western Cape Chapter Chairperson of the <a href='https://www.orssa.org.za/'>Operations Research Society of South Africa</a> (ORSSA). As the new chairperson, I am excited to take on this responsibility and to promote the wider knowledge of OR techniques and practices in the Western Cape.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Over the next year, I will be organising a series of colloquiums, workshops, and meet-ups designed to bring together practitioners and enthusiasts in the field of OR. These events will provide an opportunity for sharing knowledge, discussing new ideas, and building networks within the OR community.
</p>

I am excited about the opportunity to serve in this role and look forward to working with ORSSA members and partners to achieve our shared vision of advancing the field of Operations Research in South Africa. Stay tuned for updates on upcoming events and initiatives on our <a href='https://www.orssa.org.za/western-cape-chapter-activities'>Western Cape ORSSA Chapter Activities page</a>!
