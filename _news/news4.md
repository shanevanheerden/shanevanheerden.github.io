I'm thrilled to share some news ‚Äì I've just been elected to lead the Western Cape Chapter of <a href='https://www.orssa.org.za/'>Operations Research Society of South Africa</a> (ORSSA). It's an honor to step into this role and help grow our OR community in the region.
</p>
<p align="justify">
We've got big plans for the coming year, including regular meetups, workshops, and informal gatherings where OR practitioners and enthusiasts can connect, share ideas, and learn from each other. I'm particularly keen to create spaces where we can all benefit from each other's experiences and insights.
</p>

This is an exciting new chapter (pun intended!) and I'm looking forward to working with all of you to strengthen OR practices across South Africa. Keep an eye on our <a href='https://www.orssa.org.za/western-cape-chapter-activities'>Chapter Activities page</a> for upcoming events ‚Äì hope to see many of you there!
