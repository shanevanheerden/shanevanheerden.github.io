One of my nerdy passions is [speedcubing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedcubing), a hobby that involves solving the Rubik's cube and other twisty puzzles as quickly as possible. It all began when I saw someone solving a Rubik's cube in under a minute â€” I was hooked. I started watching YouTube tutorials and practicing until I finally managed to solve it on my own. From there, I would watch even more videos and learn new algorithms to improve my time.

One of the highlights of my speedcubing journey was participating in the Johannesburg Speedcubing Open at the Sci-Bono Discovery Centre back in November 2014. During the competition, I was able to achieve my [personal best time](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2014HEER01?tab=results-by-event) of 33.90 seconds for the 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube, and I averaged 39.91 seconds overall. But what made the experience truly unforgettable was getting to meet two of the top speedcubing professionals in the world, [Feliks Zemdegs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feliks_Zemdegs) and [Mats Valk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mats_Valk). They are known for holding several world records and winning numerous international competitions and it was inspiring to see their skills firsthand.

Speedcubing requires a lot of practice and patience, but it's a rewarding and challenging hobby. It's also a great way to keep your mind sharp and have fun at the same time. If you're looking for a new hobby to challenge yourself, I highly recommend trying speedcubing!
