I always jump at the opportunity to tackle new and interesting challenges using Machine Learning and Advanced Analytics. In the constantly changing field of AI, this is how I discover and push the bounds of what is truly possible.

## 1. The problem

In the fast-paced world of job recruitment, staying ahead of the curve requires innovative solutions. Recently, I was tasked with probably my toughest challenges by a client who operates a job recruitment firm within South Africa. I undertook the challenge of revolutionizing JobCrystal's current recruitment process by harnessing the power of advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

In this blog post, I'll take you through the intricacies of the project, detailing the architecture, preprocessing pipelines, data storage, APIs, trained models, user interface, and the intricate AI logic that powers the system.

## 2. Understanding the clients needs

Understanding the client's needs was the crucial first step in the journey. The client's existing recruitment process was time-consuming and inefficient, relying heavily on its recruiters to manually review each resume and match it to relevant job openings. This resulted in slower placement times and potential missed opportunities for both job seekers and employers.

To address these challenges, the client sought a solution that could not only streamline their current processes by automating the matching of resumes to job specifications but also bring innovation to the forefront of their operations. They wanted a system that could accurately identify relevant resumes for each open position (and vice versa), eliminating the need for manual screening.

Before developing the solution, I spent time understanding the specific needs of the client. I met with the company's recruiters to understand their key pain points and how they currently matched resumes to job openings. I also analyzed the company's data to identify any patterns or trends that could be used to improve the matching process. Through this collaborative process, I gained crucial insights into the intricacies of their current recruitment workflow, enabling myself to tailor my solution to their specific needs. As a result, I developed a set of requirements for the proposed solution:

- **Automated**: The solution should be able to automatically match resumes to job openings (and vice versa) without any manual intervention.
- **Accurate**: The solution should be able to accurately match resumes to job openings (and vice versa) based on the skills, experience, and qualifications of the candidates.
- **Scalable**: The solution should be able to handle a large volume of resumes and job openings.
- **Easy to use**: The solution should be easy to use for JobCrystal's recruiters.

## 3. The solution architecture

The success of the project relied heavily on creating a well-designed solution architecture. The system's core comprises multiple components collaborating to provide a strong and intelligent recruitment solution. Each stage, from data ingestion to storing results in ElasticSearch, was crafted with emphasis on scalability, efficiency, and smooth integration into the client's current infrastructure. Figure 1 visually depicts the interconnected components, showcasing the architecture of the solution.

    <em>Figure 1: The architecture of the proposed solution.</em> 
</div>

### 3.1. Data initialisation

To kickstart the process, the system ingests data from two primary sources: The client's FTP server and Dropbox account. The FTP server contains approximately 35 000 unlabelled documents, while Dropbox contributes around 3 000 labeled resumes associated with job specifications. This data undergoes an initialization step, whereby raw text is extracted from the documents, cleaned (using the [clean-text package](https://pypi.org/project/clean-text/)) and stored as separate sentences in an Elasticsearch database. Additionally, five metadata extraction steps are executed at this stage which encompass updating information related to file locations, industry and job title labels, and constructing sets of named entities.

### 3.2. Training the models

The system utilized various trained models to perform specific tasks associated with document preprocessing and unsupervised ranking. Two *Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers* (BERT) models are finetuned in order to predict, given the raw resume text, a candidate's industry and associated job title, giving rise to the *IndustryBERT* and *JobTitleBERT* models, respectively. The fine-tuned models ensure accurate categorization, forming the foundation for subsequent stages in the process.

A transformer-based spaCy *Named Entity Recognition* (NER) model is also trained at this stage to extract key information like key skills, location, degrees and college names which may be used for downstream filtering. Additionally, *Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection* (UMAP) and *Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise* (HDBSCAN) models are fitted to facilitate document vector representations which is an essential component in the subsequent unsupervised ranking step.

### 3.3. Preprocessing the data

All sentences comprising the raw resume text are then fed through various preprocessing steps, the outputs of which are each stored in separate indices in Elasticsearch. During this phase, the finetuned industry and job title BERT models as well as the custom NER model are leveraged, together with two pre-trained BERT-based models. More specifically:

- Each resume sentence is classified according to the most likely industry and associated job title using the IndustryBERT and JobTitleBERT models.
- Resume-specific named entities are extracted from the resume using the custom spaCy NER model.
- Each resume sentence is converted to a vector representation using the well-known [SentenceTransformers](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers) package.
- Each resume sentence is classified according to what part of a resume the sentence likely describes (e.g. experience, education, skills, certifications, awards, hobbies, references, etc.) using [a pretrained model](https://huggingface.co/manishiitg/distilbert-resume-parts-classify).

### 3.4. Data storage

Elasticsearch served as the central repository for storing preprocessed document data. Furthermore, the ability to execute database queries according to the [cosine similarity measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) makes it an extremely efficient database for enabling efficient document retrieval. A dedicated AWS EC2 instance is used to host the Elasticsearch instance.

### 3.5. The "AI logic"

The AI logic is the heart of the system, orchestrating the matchmaking process. By considering predicted industry and job titles, user-specified keyword entities, and leveraging unsupervised ranking techniques, our system intelligently filters and ranks documents, providing personalized recommendations to users. This is accomplished through 5 sequential steps facilitated by a [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) user interface displayed in Figure 2.

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/blog/blog10.3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
<div class="caption">
    <em>Figure 2: The graphic user interface for the resume-job matching solution.</em> 
</div>

- **Step 1.** The first step requires the user to select whether they are wanting to match a resume to a job specification.
- **Step 2.** The user may then upload the resume to the system in their PDF or DOCX format. Uploading a resume triggers the initialisation and prepocessing procedures described in Â§3.1 and Â§3.3, the results of which are also stored in the Elasticsearch database. During this step, the industry and corresponding job title of the candidate are predicted using the IndustryBERT and JobTitleBERT models desribed in Â§3.2, respectively.
- **Step 3.** The predicted industry and corresponding job title of the candidate are then surfaced to the user as a confirmation. If an errorous prediction was made by the model, the user has the opportunity to correct the classification at this stage. This step is important since the candidate's suitability will only be assessed according to those job specifications matching the candidate's industry and job title.
- **Step 4** In some cases, the user may wish to further filter out the suitability of the candidate to a job specification unless specific entities are not present in both documents. More specifically, the user may specify in this step that specific skills, degrees, colleges and/or histroic company names must be present in both documents. This is accomplished by utilising our custom spaCy NER model described in Â§3.2.
- **Step 5**: The combination of all information obtained in Steps 1-4 culminate in this final step. All job specifications which assume the same industry and job titles as the resume confirmed by the user in Step 3, as well as any entities specified by the user in Step 4, are queried from the Elasticsearch database as potential candidates. All candidate job specifications then undergo an unsupervised ranking procedure according to the similarity to the uploaded resume. Two unsupervised ranking algorithms where proposed and evaluated according to preference-based assessments by a job recruitment expert:
    - The first algorithm relies on ordering all candidate job specifications by utilising Elasticsearch's [text similarity functionality](https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/blog/articles/text-similarity-search-with-vectors-in-elasticsearch). More specifically, job specifications are ordered according to the [cosign similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) between the text vector representations of the job specifications according to the resume's vector representation.
    - The second algorithm takes inspiration from the recently proposed [Top2Vec approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.09470.pdf) and utilises the pre-fitted UMAP and HDBSCAN models described in Â§3.2. First, the spaCy document vector representation of the resume is reduced from 300 to 80 dimensions using the UMAP model. This is done since UMAP has been shown to be an effective preprocessing step to boost the performance of density based clustering methods. This reduced vector representation then acts as input to the HDBSCAN model which produces a cluster prediction. The most appropriate job specifications to recommend are those which share the same cluster as the resume.

The effectiveness of the resume matching system was extensively evaluated by the client using the Streamlit user interface.

> After thoughrough evaluation of the system, the client was impressed with the overall quality of the recommendations and I proceeded to productionising the solution.

## 4. Productionising the solution

 the focus has shifted to integrating the solution seamlessly into the JobCrystal UI through the development of a Flask API. This ensures that the end user, in this case, JobCrystal's team, can easily access and benefit from the system's recommendations.

The system was deployed on AWS EC2 instances and scaled to handle the volume of resumes and job specifications processed daily. I implemented continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) pipelines to ensure that the system was always up-to-date and running smoothly.

To deploy the solution into production, I followed these steps:

Infrastructure Setup: An AWS EC2 instance was provisioned to host the system components.

Deployment: The system code was deployed to the EC2 instance using a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline.

Monitoring: Monitoring tools were implemented to track system performance and resource utilization.

API Integration: The system's API was integrated with JobCrystal's existing platform to seamlessly incorporate the new functionality.

To ensure the solution's scalability and reliability, we deployed it on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instance. This cloud-based infrastructure provides the necessary resources to handle large volumes of data and user requests.

The solution was implemented using a variety of technologies, including Python, Elasticsearch, and Streamlit. The solution is deployed on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud infrastructure.

The productionization phase was a critical step in transitioning from development to a fully operational system. Figure 3 and Figure 4 provide snapshots of this process. They showcase the deployment and scaling aspects, emphasizing the robustness and scalability of our solution in a production environment.

The productionization phase involved scaling our solution for real-world deployment. Figures 3 and 4 illustrate the architecture's adaptation for live deployment, ensuring optimal performance, reliability, and accessibility.

With the successful development and testing phases behind us, the focus shifted to productionizing the solution for seamless integration into JobCrystal's operations. This stage involved deploying the entire system on AWS EC2 instances to ensure scalability, reliability, and optimal performance. The architecture was fine-tuned to handle real-time data processing, and necessary measures were implemented to monitor and maintain the system efficiently.

The true measure of success lies in the impact on JobCrystal's operations. Client feedback and testimonials serve as a testament to the positive transformations witnessed.
